    overview:
      "Designing and developing a functional, visually appealing, and user-friendly festival website that includes a booking system. Created during the 3rd semester, this project had a strong focus on modern frontend development. During the process, it was decided to build the digital solution with React/Next.js for optimal performance and a component-based architecture. The design was implemented using Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion was used for dynamic and interactive animations. Data was handled via Supabase. Foo Festival’s design is inspired by Nordic mythology, utilizing rune-like icons and fonts. For a modern touch and a rock-theme experience, a dark design was chosen, which also helps reduce energy consumption.",

      "During the process, I took responsibility for creating a high-performance and accessibility-friendly booking system, which involved the overall UI/UX with a multi-step flow. The design intentionally prioritized showing real-time responses before prompting the user for personal info, followed by a focus on good user experience. For the exam, I personally integrated EmailJS into the booking system so the user would immediately receive a transactional email confirmation. This demonstrated the completion of the flow and simulated an e-commerce experience. The entire exam project was developed through an iterative design process. This process moved from early moodboards, to low-fidelity wireframes, and finally to high-fidelity prototypes. These designs were constantly validated using user testing methods, including think-aloud tests and 5-second tests, to ensure the design was both intuitive and effective.",

     overview:
      "A small personal project where I learn Three.js. I wanted to see how to build and animate interactive 3D enviroments directly in the browser. The purpose of this project was that I wanted to know how 3D rendering works, how to apply materials and lightning, and how to create a cute visually engaging experience for the user. ",
    process:
      "The scene (canva) combines geometric shapes. I used shapes such as spheres, tori (rings) and custom star shapes to create space enviroment. I wanted the design to feel alive and interactive with motions, blooming lightning and color transitions for the main planet that responds to the user's interaction. Although its mostly technical I did focus on the user's viusal experience such as ambient motion to let the scene slowly give a sense of momvement and dimension wihout needing of manuel control. By dragging and moving the mouse while holding the click changes the spheres color which of course gives interactive feedback. This one of the ways to let the user know they feel involved in the outcome.",
    results:
      "I helped me to think more of visual design with a combination of technical implementation. This project taught me how light, shape and motion can influence how users perceive depth and interaction. I thought it might be an interesting idea for mix it with UI/UX design with creative coding.

I designed the interface and assets, then implemented the core gameplay loop by using simple HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. All the graphic assets were primarily created using Adobe Illustrator with initial sketches done in Sketchbook. These assets were rooted in the kawaii stype, which emphasizes birght colors, soft shapes and charmin playful atmosphere. Perfectly suited for the Ducky, the main character, a little yellow duckling. My focus was to create smooth interactions, responsive design and clear visual feedback for the users.",

The core objective was to significantly enhance the cafés digital presence by delivering a full-site redesign and to create a direct digital communication and content strategy for SoMe. The focus on this project was to build a coherent digital experience that effectively mirrors the authentic, warm and inviting atmosphere of the physical location, which in turn was intended to attract more customers and reinforce the local community spirit.",
    process:
      "The entire process was structured by using the double-diamond method to guarantee a fundamental user-centered design approach from initial research through to final implementation. The focus on UI/UX started with comprehensive user research including qualitative interview with the owner of the café and a card-sorting activity to define the optimal information architecture. This brought closer to the next step by building the consistent design system and iterative prototyping in figma. It was decided to implement the design with a small simple component-based framework, Astro, styling with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with smooth animation and microinteractions via GSAP. The technical stack prioritzed web accessibility and SEO, utilized Supabase for database functionality and integrated i18n feature to implement a language-toggle support for internationalization.",
    results:
      "It was confirmed by the owner to be an effective digital solution that is both scaleable and sustainable. From user testing,  iterative design process and tone-of-voice, it has showed that the redesigned site was perceived as significantly more intuitive, professional, inviting relaxed atmosphere and more user-friendly compared to the original, thereby successfully aligning the digital experience with the owner’s vision for a warm and imperfectly authentic brand presence. The resulting product confirmed the team achieved the goal of creating a digital solution that would inspire users and better meet the needs of current and potential customers.",

That research totally guided the whole aesthetic. For the design, I've been creating all the graphic assets and key visuals, like the logo, icons, and abstract backgrounds, to make sure the app has a genuinely vibrant and coherent brand identity. Right now, a big part of my focus is building an experimental Design System. This is basically the master guide that keeps every single piece of the app consistent, which is crucial for a great user experience. From the tech view, I handle most frontend development. This meant jumping headfirst into learning React Native and the Expo framework, and I use standard CSS for all the styling. I’m currently designing animations in Rive.App that I'll be implementing later on. My goal here is to bring the app's playful tone-of-voice to life through engaging visual movement and make the interactions feel like smooth user-experiment.",
